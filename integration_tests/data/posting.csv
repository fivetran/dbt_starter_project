ABOUT US:
Fivetran is part of an analytics data stack and the growing ecosystem of cloud based infrastructure companies.

After a five-minute setup, the software replicates data from applications, databases, events and files into a cloud data warehouse. 

The company began with a realization: for modern companies using cloud-based software and storage, traditional ETL tools badly underperformed, and the complicated configurations they required often led to project failures. To streamline and accelerate business intelligence projects, Fivetran developed automated connectors that come with ready-to-query schemas and effortlessly deliver data into modern, high-performant warehouses.
